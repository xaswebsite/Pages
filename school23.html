									<p>
										The Post Graduate and Research Department of Physics in association with the Xaverian Astronomical Society of St. Xavier’s College Kolkata, held a summer workshop, Hands-On Astronomy at F.E.L.O. This Astronomy and Cosmology workshop was a two-day event organized for the students of classes 11 and 12 of St. Xavier’s Collegiate School to provide them with a comprehensive understanding of basic Astronomy concepts, Cosmology theories and also to provide them with engaging hands-on activities, on these topics. The workshop was held on 7th and 8th July 2023.  The workshop aimed to promote interest in scientific research and space exploration by equipping the students with knowledge and insights in these fields.
On 7th July,2023, the first day of the workshop started with the inaugural ceremony, in Room No.-15 at 1 p.m. Reverend Fr. Principal Dr. Dominic Savio SJ, delivered the inaugural address. The Vice- Principal, the Deans of Arts and Science, the ex-Dean of Science, along with the Head of The Department of Physics, Dr. Shibaji Banerjee were also present. Following Fr. Principal’s inspiring address, the students were also addressed by Dr. Shibaji Banerjee. After the tea break, the students were escorted by the volunteers to MCVA 3, to begin the actual essence of the workshop. 
Dr. Suparna Roy Chowdhury, delivered a captivating and enriching talk on the nuances of Astrophysics and Astronomy. The students were enthralled by the talk. The talk was followed by a sumptuous lunch break. Dr. Shibaji Banerjee, delivered an equally engrossing and fascinating talk on Cosmology. The students were yet again beguiled by the expansiveness and the subtleties of the universe. To make the learning process more dynamic, the lecture was followed by, the long-awaited Hands-On Session at the Father Eugene Lafont Observatory. The gloomy, cloudy weather dampened the moods of the students as they could not observe anything but understanding the workings of the instruments and handling the telescope and various other instruments, surely cheered them up and ended the first day on a rather sweet note. </p>
<p>On 8th July 2023, the second day of the workshop started at 12 noon. It began by two extremely interesting hands-on Astronomy sessions conducted by the ex and current students of the Department of Physics. The engaging and riveting Cosmology session was also conducted by the ex and current students of the Department. Feedback forms were filled out by the students to help us grow in a forward direction and with this, the two-day summer workshop came to an end. </p>
									
<p>In conclusion, organizing summer workshops on Astronomy and Cosmology serves as a significant contribution toward promoting interest in scientific research and exploration of space. By fostering a deeper appreciation for the wonders of the cosmos, these workshops inspire young minds to pursue careers in fields related to Astrophysics or Cosmology. We wish to continue these summer workshops and many more related activities in the years to come!</p></div>
