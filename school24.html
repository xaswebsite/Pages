										Summer School 2024: Hands On Astronomy at F.E.L.O</p>
									<p>“Something as mere as age in the immensity of Curiosity, is but a young Sun against the entirety of the Sky.”</p>
								<p>Hands-on-Astronomy at F.E.L.O 2024, organised by The Postgraduate and Research Department of Physics in association with The Xaverian Astronomical Society, was a much-awaited event of the year which marked the ending societal event of XAS for the academic session 2023-24.  It was a two-day summer workshop on Astronomy and Astrophysics designed for the students in their 11th and 12th standards of St. Xavier’s Collegiate School and Don Bosco School, Bandel. Spanning the expanse of two days, 19th and 20th of July, this Summer Workshop diverged into several activities, ranging from theoretical session to hands-on work at F.E.L.O and computational analysis of experimental data, with a collective aim of inculcating the significance and wonders of Astronomy and Astrophysics in the minds of the young enthusiasts.	</p>	
								<p>The workshop was inaugurated on 19th July, at the D’Souza Hall, Room 15, by Father Principal Rev. Dr Dominic Savio SJ with his inspiring address to the students, speakers and the committee involved, followed closely by the felicitation of the Speaker Dr Sanjay Kumar Ghosh, retired professor from Bose Institute, Kolkata. 
<br>The Inaugural Ceremony was followed by the address and speech by Dr Shibaji Banerjee, Head of the Department of Physics. A short Tea break followed closely, which opened the hours of the Video-Presentation and the Student Session carried out by the current students and Alumni of the Department of Physics including; Snigdha Bose, Rupam Jash and Saptarshi Bhaduri. Students were briefed on the introductory ideas and concepts in Astrophysics; including Astronomical coordinates and units, which significantly boosted their intellectual appeal and enthusiasm towards the day. 
The Student session ended with the inception of the most-awaited Speaker’s Session of the day, by Dr. Ghosh, titled “Astronomy: Gateway to the Cosmos”. The Speaker’s Session and a question-and-answer session with Dr Ghosh engaged the students in venturing into their curiosities and interests, and helped them gain insight in the topics of Stellar objects and evolution of the Universe. After the scrumptious lunch break, wherein the food was sponsored by ‘Stun the Sun’,  the students were volunteered to the Fr. Eugene Lafont Observatory for an Observatory session. Due to inapt weather conditions, telescope observation could not be carried out. However, students were grounded with the workings and methodology of handling the Telescope. The first day of the workshop ended with a beguiling session at F.E.L.O, which promised a greater cause of glory for another day.

								<p>20th July was initiated with the felicitation of the Guest Speaker, Dr Tapas Kumar Das, Associate Professor at Theoretical Physics Division of Harish Chandra Research Institute, by Dr. Suparna Roychowdhury, Deputy President of XAS and faculty at the Department of Physics. The first Students Session followed closely, with a special focus on Solar Astrophysics, which ranged from topics of Photometry to Sunspot Analysis, taught by the students and alumni of the Physics Department. 
									Shortly after the first student session, Dr Das took the stage for his mind-bending talk , ‘Our Home, Light and Darkness’ which fuelled the zeal of the students. A second student session was carried out, which was followed by a Data Analysis Session of Solar Sunspot data at Ranjan Ray Lab of Computational Physics, which served as a lead-in experience to the students in the industrial aspect of the experimental Astrophysics.

								<p>After the set of panoramic activities through the two days, the final valedictory was served, and the second day came to an end with the Vote of Thanks addressed by Snigdha Bose of the Postgraduate Department of Physics. The distribution of certificates for the students followed shortly after. 
The two-day workshop witnessed the inflammation of curiosity, its power and the felicity of discovery and knowledge, which fuelled the incentive of the committee, for an even greater year to celebrate.
