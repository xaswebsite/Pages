										<h1>Aiming For The Stars-Women's Day
										</h1>
									</header>
								<p>On the 25th of March 2023, the women of the Xaverian Astronomical Society (XAS) in collaboration with the Post Graduate and Research Department of Physics, organized a science-cum-astronomy awareness session, “Aiming for the Stars”, for the underprivileged girls of our society under the guidance of the National Service Scheme (NSS). For our venture, we went to the Calcutta Muslim Orphanage located at Ripon Street to teach the girls there that Science is nothing to be scared of and to encourage them to think scientifically and maybe select Science as their field of study in the future.
									<br>We had stayed back in college the day before the event making charts on science and women in science. On the day, when we reached the orphanage, we were greeted by many girls from classes 8 to 10 who were eager to learn about science.
									<br>The event started off with us introducing ourselves and asking the girls to introduce themselves too. Most girls said they had plans of taking Bengali, Geography, or English as their subject of study in the future. Only one girl replied that she liked studying Life Science. We showed them the various charts about science and various women who had to overcome many adversities to become successful in science. They were fascinated to learn about the many Indian women in STEM such as Kalpana Chawla and Anandibai Gopalrao Joshi who had excelled in their fields.
									<br>The girls had many questions for us such as why we decided to study science, why people weigh lesser on the moon, and how they should excel in their science classes without being able to afford tuition classes.
									<br>Then we divided them into groups so that we could show them presentations that we had prepared on our laptops and to facilitate one-to-one interaction between the girls and us. The girls listened in awe as we explained to them how the phases of the moon change, showed them pictures of Venus' occultation that had taken place a day before and told them the story of Marie Curie's struggles at the end of which she became the winner of two Nobel prizes.
									<br>The event ended with one girl from each group telling us about what they learned and what they thought of our presentations. We also handed out leaflets with information regarding the various scholarships they can avail of for their further studies in science.
									</p>
									<p>The visit provided us an insight into the lives of these underprivileged girls who despite their circumstances are filled with a passion for learning which made them so eager to listen to what we had to say. The event was also very emotionally fulfilling for us students as we all left with the feeling that we had done some good work and had been able to help some people. The event highlighted the importance of supporting institutions providing a haven for vulnerable children. It also reinforced the fact that it is not that Indian girls lack interest in science but that like every person they just need someone to relate to and tell them that it may be difficult but never impossible nor boring to decide to study science.</p>

								<p>Experiences of a few of us who had one on one interaction with the girls:

									<br>“We were very scared to hurt the sentiments of the girls and the institution alike with the topic that we had approached, but to our surprise, we found enthusiasm and thirst among those girls to know about our lifestyles and what inspired us to take up science. It was altogether a very warming experience for us.”

									<br>“The girls were genuinely interested to learn about science and astronomy. They asked us pertinent and out-of-the-box questions which encouraged us to discuss topics in astronomy and women in science in a more detailed manner. After we distributed the scholarship pamphlets, they were very eager to learn about the different programs. They huddled up and listened very carefully as one of us explained the various programs to them. This experience will truly be etched in my memory forever.”

									<br>"The girls were very enthusiastic and eager to learn. The teaching-learning experience was very conducive and interactive. We truly had an enriching experience. We also learned a lot about their lives and their struggles. By the end of the event, the girls became extremely friendly and gave us a very warm goodbye.  Some also expressed that they wanted to see us again in the near future."

									<br>"The girls were extremely fascinated to hear about astronomy and the basic sciences. We tried our best to motivate them to take up science. We received a warm welcome from their end. Their jovial faces clearly told us that they enjoyed the discussion on science. On being asked what they liked about the session, they happily declared that they enjoyed every bit of it. This day will always remain in our hearts. "

									<br>"It is when you learn to impart your knowledge is the actual achievement of your knowledge. The heartwarming welcome that our session received there, and the enthusiasm with which the importance of science was understood by those smiling faces helped us realize how we might have done our small bit in creating many future scientists. There's nothing to say but feel the gratitude leaking out of us for such a beautiful time."

									<br>“It was a very enriching and productive experience to spend time with the girls. Their welcoming gestures and eagerness to learn truly warmed our hearts. They were very responsive and interested which in turn encouraged us to speak and work even better. They even expressed their desire to see us again. All in all, it was a very fruitful initiative and we hope to have more such events in the near future.”

								<br>	“Initially I had assumed that the girls may not be so much interested in this, but it was not at all the case. They were very welcoming and eager to learn all about what science is. They seemed to have enjoyed the session- learning about the women that made a mark in science, finding courage to think about pursuing science in future and openly sharing their difficulties in science. The response was overwhelming, we really had a beautiful time working with the girls. Overall, it was a great experience and we look forward to more such events in future”

							<br>	“The visit was way more fun and enriching than what I had expected it to be. Rather than fear or hesitation, the girls showed vigor and interest. They provided an amazing example of the mindset filled with curiosity and courage that people should have when pursuing science. Although they seemed slightly overwhelmed and embarrassed in the beginning, it didn’t take long for them to join in and have fun with all of us. It was fun trying to find ways to explain things better to them. Overall, it was a splendid time interacting with all the girls there and an extremely enriching experience for us.”

							<br>	“It is always a great experience to be able to interact with the younger minds of our generation and hence, this Women’s Day was extra special and heartwarming because we got the opportunity to not only interact with these enthusiastic girls, but were also able to impart the knowledge we had to them. We tried our best to make them understand the topics such as astronomy and the science behind it. The girls were very communicative and welcoming and listened to us very intently. Overall, it was a great experience being able to meet them and I am very grateful.”
