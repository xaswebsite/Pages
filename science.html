										<h1>National Science Day 2024
										</h1>
									</header>
									<p>The Xaverian Astronomical Society in association with the Postgraduate and Research Department of Physics organised a National Science Day celebration on 28th February, 2024 in the room 41 of St. Xavier’s College (Autonomous), Park Street, Kolkata.</p>
									<p>The Inaugural Address was presented by Rev. Dr. Dominic Savio, SJ, Principal, St. Xavier’s College (Autonomous), Kolkata. This was followed by a short video put together by the working committee introducing the history of National Science Day and Father Eugene Lafont Observatory.
									</p>
									<p>Following this was the Speaker Session at 3:30 to 5:00 p.m. Dr. Pratik Tarafdar of The Institute of Mathematical Sciences(IMSc), Chennai, gave a fascinating presentation titled, Tuning into ‘Cosmic Hum’: The first hints of a stochastic Gravitational Wave Background. The first direct detection of kilometre-length spacetime ripples was made by the LIGO-Virgo collaborations in 2015. However, continuous gravitational wave emissions have been predicted in colliding galaxies from supermassive black hole binaries. Superposition of emissions from multiple such binaries creates a persistent stochastic gravitational wave background in nanohertz frequencies. Nature has gifted us ultra-precise galactic clocks named 'millisecond pulsars' as potential tools to detect these light-years-long gravitational waves using pulsar timing techniques. Recent results announced by Indian, European, North American, Australian, and Chinese Pulsar Timing Arrays, unravel the first strong direct hints of such a cosmic gravitational wave background.</p>
								<p>There were two lunar observational sessions, one being 28th February, 5:30 p.m. onwards, and the other the 4th of March, at the same time.. These were conducted in the Father Eugene Lafont Observatory. Many students participated to observe Jupiter and its four largest moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. </p>
								<p>This celebration brought the students and professors closer together to gain knowledge about the detection of Gravitational Wave Background. The lunar observational sessions were a fun and interactive way to understand the operation of Father Eugene Lafont Observatory.</p>
