					<p>"A generation lost in space"
					<br>-Don McLean<br>
					Ever since the dawn of mankind, generations have been enthralled with what lies beyond us. In our feeble attempts to understand the great infinite, The Xaverian Astronomical Society, brings in our contribution of making astronomy and its related studies accessible and understandable to all, helping many more generations to get lost in the vast galactic ocean.
					<br>Onwards and Upwards, <br>
					Dr. Suparna Roychowdhury, <br>
					Deputy President,<br>
					Xaverian Astronomical Society.<br></p>
					<p>The Xaverian Astronomical Society, known commonly by its acronym XAS is an integrated community of the members of St. Xavier’s College (Autonomous) Kolkata, united in pursuit of knowledge and experience in the fields of Astronomy, Astrophysics, and Space Science. It was founded in 2019, followed by its inauguration on the 3rd of September, marking the very first initiative of the college towards Academic Development in Astronomy. Fairly young, directed chiefly by Father Principal Rev. Dr. Dominic Savio SJ as the President, Dr. Suparna Roychowdhury as the Deputy President, and Dr. Ashadul Halder as Deputy Vice-President, the Xaverian Astronomical Society witnessed its prime establishment through the collective pertinacity of inter-departmental enthusiasts, the esteemed professors of the Post Graduate and Research Department of Physics, and in its association with Fr. Eugène Lafont Observatory (FELO), India’s largest active institutional Observatory, located at the rooftop of St. Xavier’s College. Under the able guidance of Dr. Shibaji Banerjee, the current Head of the Department of Physics and Assistant Director of FELO, the observatory has flourished manifold.</p>
					<p>An association like XAS helps one to answer, to validate even the smallest of curiosities one may have about astronomy.
					<br>As much as many minds are intrigued by astronomy, there is little resource to cultivate their interest in their formative years. That is where XAS comes into play, bringing in curated events throughout the year to help assess if even one is interested in taking up Astronomy and Astrophysics as a developmental experience. 
					One such effort took the form of an outreach program last year where members of XAS in collaboration with NSS (National Service Scheme), on account of International Womens’ Day visited an orphanage to help them understand the basics of Astronomy by delivering lectures and holding demonstrations related to it. 
					<br>The Summer School Programme is a public outreach event arranged for the senior students of secondary and higher secondary schools like St. Xavier’s Collegiate School (Kolkata), Don Bosco School (Bandel), and others in the last two years, post covid, where the participants got a taste of Astronomy through our workshop ‘Hands-On Astronomy at FELO’ 
					‘Astrovaganza’, the bi-annual flagship event is a collective effort of the society to give Astronomy a comprehensive approach for college students. It is a series of activities and events that includes seminars, workshops, observation sessions, and astrophotography sessions. The first edition of  Astrovaganza, held in October, 2023, witnessed a very enriching talk on Chandrayan- 1, 2 and 3 by Dr. Tirtha Pratim Das, ISRO scientist, St Xavier’s alumni followed by a quiz on Astronomy. The second edition of Astrovaganza held in April of 2024, had a very interesting talk by imminent Space Scientist, Prof. Dibyendu Nandi, Prof, IISER Kolkata and an exhibition and talk on astrophotography by Mr. Soumyadeep Mukherjee, Astrophotographer, Astronomads Bangla. Observation sessions, for students not only of our college but also other colleges, were held.
					<br>XAS in a way is well mounted to help interested students carry out research work in the observatory. One such research project was a radio telescope made by students of the Physics Department. Research papers, three in number, have been published by members of XAS and students from the Department of Physics.
					<br>We, at XAS, saw yet again the enthusiasm students share for the society when we opened the registrations for membership, for the current academic year (2024-2025). 
					What XAS has always tried to do as a society is to give a platform to each person who is fascinated by Astrophysics to further cultivate their interest. However, a mere interest in Astronomy is not enough to satiate the urge to learn more. A humongous amount of logistics and other not very easily accessible means are involved in this entire collective learning exercise. XAS, rather the members of XAS, make an effort to bring these strings together with full support and encouragement from the College and our Principal, Rev. Dr. Dominic Savio, SJ. XAS at its core pledges to make Astronomy accessible to one and all. To those who thought, they will have to wait for sometime to learn more on Cosmology and Astrophysics, being a part of XAS will give them an idea to dream about.</p>
