										<br> OCTOBER 13, 2O23</p>
										
										<p> 13th of October 2023 marked a momentous occasion for the “Xaverian Astronomical Society”, as XAS celebrated its inauguration after finally having sealed its spot as one of the official societies of St. Xavier’s College (Autonomous), Kolkata.<br>
										To commemorate this eventful achievement, XAS organised a seminar, to be followed by a quiz competition in the Seminar Hall, Department of Education from 2:45p.m. to 5p.m. </p>
										<p>With the dignitaries and audiences seated eagerly, the seminar finally began with the encouraging inaugural address by Reverend Father Principal Dr. Dominic Savio SJ. As Father Principal blessed the audience with his words of wisdom and best wishes, the seminar proceeded with the introductory speech of Dr. Shibaji Banerjee, HoD of the Department of Physics and Assistant Director of Father Eugene Lafont Observatory which is handled closely by the member of XAS. Dr. Suparna Roychowdhury, Deputy President, Xaverian Astronomical Society, began the day by introducing the guest speaker, Dr. Tirtha Pratim Das, Director of Space Science Programme Office (SSPO), ISRO, who had joined in via online platform, followed by the vote of thanks delivered by the secretary of XAS, Mayukh Chatterjee.<br>
										The centre-stage of the seminar, however, was graced by Dr. Tirtha Pratim Das. Dr. Das conducted the seminar as he delivered an enlightening segment on the physics and engineering behind ISRO’s recent lunar mission “CHANDRAYAAN 3”. Soon after Dr. Das showered the audiences with his knowledge, he was met by a round of questions by the students in the audiences. <br>
										As the seminar and the question-and-answer round culminated, a brief refreshment break was announced which was followed by the much awaited “Quizathon” – a quiz competition based on astronomy. The teams who had already qualified the prelims took up the gauntlet for the final prize. After a round of intense battling of brains, the “Quizathon” finally came to a sweet end with Uditi Nag and Bipasha Bhattacharjee of 2nd Year from the Department of Physics emerged victorious. Besides huge praise and appreciations, they were awarded a memento, pen, and a certificate of victory from XAS. <br>
										With this, the inaugural event of the Xaverian Astronomical Society reached its end and indeed it proved to be a day to remember. With XAS now among the official societies of St. Xavier’s College, this event marked one of the many impending occasions of success and glory.
